# 2D_graphics_final_project
Full submission of my final code for 2D Graphics

There are multiple files to this since I jumped between topics this semester. 

NOTE - I did not get the blur python file working so I uploaded the fourier transform code with a Gaussian blur kernel instead. I was also going to make a GUI to view my project which also did not happen. 

Files:
- color_inversion.py - color inverter
- color_isolation.py - isolates a color and turns the photo purple
- conversion.py - longform colorblindness simulation with each data conversion in its own function.
- color_blindness.py - shortform colorblindness where the conversions are multiplied together to get one matrix to multiply
- gaussian.py - same fourier transform that we did in class, but with the Gaussian blur
- achromatopsia.py - complete colorblindness simulator or the greyscale code used in class

The formula for the colorblindness simulator is listed in the link posted in the file
